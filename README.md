# dark-light-mode-toggle-extension
An extension that can apply dark mode to _almost_ any site.
No tracking. No external libraries. No nonsense.

## Why should I use this extension?
There are certainly better extensions out there, so here are some reasons to use this one:
1. We don't use external libraries
2. We don't use, share, or sell any of your data
3. We are open source, so you can improve this extension or fork it and use the code.
4. We are ultra-lightweight

## Features
- Applies dark/light mode with one click of the extension icon
- Saves the history of your dark/light mode preference and applies dark mode on page load.

## Looking for something to contribute?
- Automate packaging - minify the `js` and package it into appropriate filenames
- Add an npm script to zip the extension into a package that can be submitted to chrome store.
- Find and fix console errors
- Increase support for sites that don't work

## Contributing
As of now, contributions are welcome. Please present your PRs in a professional manner. Here are some tips:
- Be kind and use kind language
- Don't add external libs
- Explain your feature or fix
- Highlight trade-offs
- Be patient
